## Credits

Most of the knowledge that was used to make this quiz function came from the front-end bootcamp lessons. However, there was some neat little code that I found on stack overflow which enhanced the functionality. I found out how to remove Local Storage data by refreshing your browser tab as well as a button that would clear out specific locally stored data. I further learnt about how to use intervals not only for timers but for words and questions, which is evident by running the quiz. I also took some time to research about how to add sound queues into event listeners.
